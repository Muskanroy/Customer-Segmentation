# Customer-Segmentation(Unsupervised learning project)

Throughout this project, we are going to analyze the spending behaviours of several customers in some product categories. The main goals of the project are:
1.	Grouping customers in clusters of similar spending characteristics.
2.	Describing the variations within the different clusters, in order to find the best delivery structure for each group.

## Dataset
Dataset contains the customer spending on different products.

## Objective
The objective is to :
1.	analyze the dataset and
2.	define customer segments based on spending behaviors using machine learning and dimensionality reduction.

## Several unsupervised tools are implemented:
1.	K-Means. Optimal number of segments are determined using Elbow method.
2.	PCA (Principal Composant Analysis). Apply dimensionality reduction.

## Project Structure
1.	Data Exploration
*	Data wrangling and cleaning
* Data analysis and visualization for salient elements, trends and correlations
2.	Feature Relevance
3.	Data preprocessing
* Feature scaling
*	Outlier removal
4.	Principal Componant Analysis
5.	K-means application
